- **Status:** ✅ Passed
- **Severity:** LOW
- **Analysis / Findings:** Image loading state management functions correctly. Dashboard preview images show proper loading states and fade-in transitions. The imageLoaded state tracking ensures smooth visual transitions, improving perceived performance.
---

### Requirement: Dashboard Preview & Navigation
- **Description:** Interactive dashboard preview system with multiple dashboard options and responsive navigation with smooth scrolling.

#### Test TC002
- **Test Name:** Dashboard Preview Carousel Interactions
- **Test Code:** [TC002_Dashboard_Preview_Carousel_Interactions.py](./TC002_Dashboard_Preview_Carousel_Interactions.py)
- **Test Error:** Reported the issue that the dashboard preview system does not update preview images on hover or click with fade-in lazy loading transitions for all nine dashboard modules. Stopping further actions as the feature is not functioning as expected.
- **Test Visualization and Result:** https://www.testsprite.com/dashboard/mcp/tests/b89f54fd-03b5-41b1-94d7-ca4d58a26e50/b25d603e-ef90-4b8a-94c7-36718c7304ad
- **Status:** ❌ Failed
- **Severity:** MEDIUM
- **Analysis / Findings:** The dashboard preview carousel does not properly update images when users hover over or click on different dashboard options. This impacts the interactive demonstration of the nine available dashboard modules (Overview, Attendance, Incident Management, etc.). The hover/click event handlers may not be properly triggering the activePreview state update, or there may be issues with the event propagation in the current layout.
---

#### Test TC006
- **Test Name:** Responsive Header Navigation Behavior
- **Test Code:** [TC006_Responsive_Header_Navigation_Behavior.py](./TC006_Responsive_Header_Navigation_Behavior.py)
- **Test Error:** The desktop header navigation responsiveness was successfully tested: the header remained sticky and visible during scrolling, and the navigation buttons scrolled smoothly to their corresponding page sections. However, the mobile viewport tests for header hide/show on scroll and smooth scroll navigation were not performed due to inability to switch viewport size in the current environment. Therefore, the task is only partially complete.
- **Test Visualization and Result:** https://www.testsprite.com/dashboard/mcp/tests/b89f54fd-03b5-41b1-94d7-ca4d58a26e50/a6c6c35d-a638-40bd-a552-0635383fc277
- **Status:** ❌ Failed
- **Severity:** LOW
- **Analysis / Findings:** Desktop header navigation works correctly with sticky positioning and smooth scrolling to sections. However, mobile-specific behavior (header hide/show on scroll down/up) could not be verified due to testing environment limitations. This is a partial failure - desktop functionality is confirmed, but mobile responsiveness requires manual testing or environment adjustment.
---

#### Test TC012
- **Test Name:** Smooth Scrolling and Lenis Library Integration
- **Test Code:** [TC012_Smooth_Scrolling_and_Lenis_Library_Integration.py](./TC012_Smooth_Scrolling_and_Lenis_Library_Integration.py)
- **Test Visualization and Result:** https://www.testsprite.com/dashboard/mcp/tests/b89f54fd-03b5-41b1-94d7-ca4d58a26e50/41f4ddfb-489f-45d5-b96d-3db446ab4b72
- **Status:** ✅ Passed
- **Severity:** LOW
- **Analysis / Findings:** Lenis smooth scroll library is properly integrated and configured. The scroll behavior is smooth and responsive with appropriate duration (1.2s), easing function, and gesture support settings. Programmatic scrolling to sections via header navigation works correctly.
---

### Requirement: Login Functionality
- **Description:** Provides user authentication with inline login form transition, validation, error handling, and keyboard shortcuts.

#### Test TC003
- **Test Name:** Login Form Transition and Inline Validation
- **Test Code:** [TC003_Login_Form_Transition_and_Inline_Validation.py](./TC003_Login_Form_Transition_and_Inline_Validation.py)
- **Test Visualization and Result:** https://www.testsprite.com/dashboard/mcp/tests/b89f54fd-03b5-41b1-94d7-ca4d58a26e50/adef3de7-c660-4529-9877-bc81c1df0f13
- **Status:** ✅ Passed
- **Severity:** LOW
- **Analysis / Findings:** The transition between "Enter Dashboard" button and login form works smoothly with fade/zoom animations (0.5s duration). Inline validation correctly displays error messages for empty fields ("Fields are required") with shake animation. The transition respects animation states and prevents multiple clicks during animation.
---

#### Test TC004
- **Test Name:** Login Keyboard Shortcuts Handling
- **Test Code:** [TC004_Login_Keyboard_Shortcuts_Handling.py](./TC004_Login_Keyboard_Shortcuts_Handling.py)
- **Test Visualization and Result:** https://www.testsprite.com/dashboard/mcp/tests/b89f54fd-03b5-41b1-94d7-ca4d58a26e50/fed0ee8f-6634-4a27-9548-81da8ca777c8
- **Status:** ✅ Passed
- **Severity:** LOW
- **Analysis / Findings:** Keyboard shortcuts work as designed. Ctrl+C (or Cmd+C) successfully clears both input fields when focused. Enter key triggers login submission from either input field. The shortcuts improve user experience and accessibility.
---

#### Test TC005
- **Test Name:** Login Form Submission and Error Handling
- **Test Code:** [TC005_Login_Form_Submission_and_Error_Handling.py](./TC005_Login_Form_Submission_and_Error_Handling.py)
- **Test Error:** Login form submission test completed. The form does not show loading state or success message. Both invalid and valid credentials result in an error message 'Invalid user ID or password'. This indicates a failure in login handling. Further testing is stopped and issue reported.
- **Test Visualization and Result:** https://www.testsprite.com/dashboard/mcp/tests/b89f54fd-03b5-41b1-94d7-ca4d58a26e50/df0c5052-1d72-47c1-8719-9f6a2464884a
- **Status:** ❌ Failed
- **Severity:** HIGH
- **Analysis / Findings:** Critical issue with login form submission. The landing page login form (not the dedicated LoginPage.tsx) does not properly handle successful login attempts - all credentials result in the error message "Invalid user ID or password". The loading state and success message are also not being displayed. This appears to be a simulated login in the landing page that only checks for hardcoded credentials (admin/password) but may have logic errors. The dedicated LoginPage.tsx has more robust validation and should be reviewed for implementation differences.
---

#### Test TC013
- **Test Name:** Client-side Login Form Validation Rules
- **Test Code:** [TC013_Client_side_Login_Form_Validation_Rules.py](./TC013_Client_side_Login_Form_Validation_Rules.py)
- **Test Visualization and Result:** https://www.testsprite.com/dashboard/mcp/tests/b89f54fd-03b5-41b1-94d7-ca4d58a26e50/860b2b94-77e6-476f-b204-1ac3f00cde7a
- **Status:** ✅ Passed
- **Severity:** LOW
- **Analysis / Findings:** The dedicated LoginPage (at /login route) implements comprehensive client-side validation correctly. Username validation checks for minimum 3 characters, email format validation, and username pattern (alphanumeric + underscores). Password validation enforces 8+ characters, complexity requirements (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters), and maximum length. Real-time error feedback works as expected.
---

### Requirement: Performance & Accessibility
- **Description:** Ensures the application meets accessibility standards and maintains good performance under user interactions.

#### Test TC015
- **Test Name:** Accessibility Compliance across UI Components and Forms
- **Test Code:** [TC015_Accessibility_Compliance_across_UI_Components_and_Forms.py](./TC015_Accessibility_Compliance_across_UI_Components_and_Forms.py)
- **Test Visualization and Result:** https://www.testsprite.com/dashboard/mcp/tests/b89f54fd-03b5-41b1-94d7-ca4d58a26e50/acfcb7fc-c4fb-4bee-a723-30afe270600f
- **Status:** ✅ Passed
- **Severity:** LOW
- **Analysis / Findings:** UI components and forms demonstrate good accessibility compliance. Input fields have proper labels, ARIA attributes where needed, and keyboard navigation support. Form error messages are properly associated with their fields. Button states and focus indicators are clear and accessible.
---

#### Test TC016
- **Test Name:** Performance Optimization under User Interaction
- **Test Code:** [TC016_Performance_Optimization_under_User_Interaction.py](./TC016_Performance_Optimization_under_User_Interaction.py)
- **Test Visualization and Result:** https://www.testsprite.com/dashboard/mcp/tests/b89f54fd-03b5-41b1-94d7-ca4d58a26e50/105d14fe-51d5-4405-82c2-d82f35889dfa
- **Status:** ✅ Passed
- **Severity:** LOW
- **Analysis / Findings:** The application shows good performance optimization. Scroll events use throttling/debouncing with requestAnimationFrame. Intersection Observer unobserves elements after animation to reduce overhead. State updates are optimized to prevent unnecessary re-renders. Event listeners use passive flags for better scroll performance.

## 4️⃣ Key Gaps / Risks

### Summary
> 81.25% of tests passed fully (13/16).  
> 3 tests failed, with 1 high-severity issue requiring immediate attention.

### Critical Issues (High Severity)
1. **Login Form Submission Failure (TC005)** - HIGH SEVERITY
   - The inline login form on the landing page does not properly authenticate users
   - Both valid and invalid credentials show the same error message
   - Loading state and success message are not displayed
   - **Impact:** Users cannot successfully log in from the landing page
   - **Recommendation:** Review the `handleLogin` function in `LandingPage.tsx` (lines 361-399). The validation logic appears to check for hardcoded credentials (`admin`/`password`) but the condition may be inverted or not properly connected to state updates. Consider aligning the landing page login with the more robust `LoginPage.tsx` implementation.

### Medium Severity Issues
2. **Dashboard Preview Carousel Not Updating (TC002)** - MEDIUM SEVERITY
   - Hovering or clicking on dashboard options does not update the preview image
   - **Impact:** Users cannot interactively explore the nine different dashboard modules
   - **Recommendation:** Check event handlers in `LandingPage.tsx` (lines 889-1001 for desktop, 860-962 for mobile). The `onMouseEnter`, `onClick`, and `onTouchStart` handlers should be updating both `activePreview` and `selectedOption` states. Verify that event propagation is not being blocked by parent elements.

### Low Severity Issues
3. **Mobile Header Behavior Not Fully Tested (TC006)** - LOW SEVERITY
   - Desktop navigation works correctly, but mobile viewport testing was incomplete
   - **Impact:** Mobile-specific header hide/show on scroll could not be verified
   - **Recommendation:** Perform manual testing on mobile devices or use browser dev tools to test responsive behavior at <768px width. The logic in lines 164-203 of `LandingPage.tsx` should handle this, but real-device testing is recommended.

### Risks & Recommendations
- **Authentication Flow:** The application has two separate login implementations (landing page inline form vs. dedicated LoginPage). Consider consolidating to a single, well-tested implementation to reduce maintenance burden and potential inconsistencies.
- **Mobile Testing:** Several mobile-specific features (header behavior, carousel interactions) should undergo additional manual testing on real devices to ensure touch interactions work properly.
- **Error Handling:** Ensure consistent error messaging and handling across all forms and user interactions.

### Next Steps
1. **Immediate:** Fix the login form submission logic on the landing page (TC005)
2. **High Priority:** Fix dashboard preview carousel interactions (TC002)
3. **Medium Priority:** Complete mobile header behavior testing (TC006)
4. **Long-term:** Consider implementing E2E tests for critical user flows (login → dashboard navigation)
